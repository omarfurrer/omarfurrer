Create child themes at the click of a button.

== Description ==

Create child themes from any non-child theme at the click of a button.

This plugin is multisite compatible; if used on a multisite network, controls for creating child themes will be in the network admin instead of the regular site admin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `child-themify` directory and its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or your custom location if you manually changed the location).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can now create a child theme of any non-child theme you have installed by going to the themes page and clicking "Create a child theme" from the actions links of the theme of your choice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get some help? =

I'd really prefer that you use [Github's issue tracker](https://github.com/johnpbloch/child-themify/issues/new). The [WordPress.org support forum for the plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/child-themify) will work too, it will just take longer.

== Screenshots ==

2. Single site administration area
